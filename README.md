# AdventureWorks Financial Performance Analysis

## Objective
The Chief Financial Officer wanted to know which markets generated the highest revenue and profitability in order to decide where to invest the next marketing dollar.
Using data from orders, products, territories, and campaigns, the task was to prepare an analysis that highlighted market priorities, budget optimization, and profitability.

## Activities and Skills Applied in This Project 
* **Navigating a relational schema and writing JOINs to combine tables**
  * The first rows of each table were explored to identify join keys and to construct a simple diagram illustrating how the tables are related.
  * Tables were joined to create a single source for queries.

* **Validating and performing quality assurance (QA) through total and margin checks**
  Totals were validated by comparing them with SUM, ensuring that aggregates by country/territory matched the overall totals. Products with margin_pct < 0 were identified, and finally, nulls and duplicates were reviewed using NULL.
